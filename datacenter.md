Bio Energy

"Biomass is organic material that comes from plants and animals, and it is a renewable source of energy.

Biomass contains stored energy from the sun. Plants absorb the sun's energy in a process called photosynthesis. When biomass is burned, the chemical energy in biomass is released as heat. Biomass can be burned directly or converted to liquid biofuels or biogas that can be burned as fuels.

Examples of biomass and their uses for energy

Wood and wood processing wastes—burned to heat buildings, to produce process heat in industry, and to generate electricity
Agricultural crops and waste materials—burned as a fuel or converted to liquid biofuels
Food, yard, and wood waste in garbage—burned to generate electricity in power plants or converted to biogas in landfills
Animal manure and human sewage—converted to biogas, which can be burned as a fuel"

Waste heat in datacenters
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_data_center#Reusing_waste_heat

"Reusing waste heat
Data centers use electric power, releasing more than 98 percent of this electricity as heat. Waste heat can be actively reused, and a data center becomes a closed-loop heating system with no waste. Examples include:

The IBM Reusing Data Center in Switzerland, where the heat warms a local swimming pool
In Finland, the Yandex and Academica data centers replacing the heat used by 500-1,000 homes with data-center energy.
Amazon reused heat from a nearby data center for a biosphere project in Seattle.[17]"




E.Datacenter.5: 
Pick a country, state, or company from Section 4.1.11 and summarize
their efforts towards renewable energy and impacts within the
society

"Microsoft showed its dedication to green energy when it invested in a 20 year agreement RES Americas wind farm for 100% of its energy.  By the end of 2015 the Keechi Wind Farm Project will contain 55 turbines capable of handling the 300 megawatts of power that the San Antonio, Texas data center will need. This data center was modeled after the Microsoft facility in Quincy, Washington. At this location Microsoft hosts applications such as Microsoft.com, Hotmail, and Windows Live Messenger."
